# Contributing to MineClone 2/5
Ok, you want to help out and contribute to the MineClone 2 or 5 source code, but are wondering where to start. Just pick something that you want to help with that interests you! It might be best to start out with some easier things that are less important and work up to more advanced projects as you gain more experience and knowledge. If you don't know how to code, or don't want to do the coding, we always need testers to test new features or the game overall.

Please read https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/src/branch/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for more information

Here is an abridged version of https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/src/branch/master/CONTRIBUTING.md:

If you are a non programmer, you could:

* Report Bugs.
* Request Features.
* Test Code.
* Contribute assests such as models, textures, or sounds.
* Contribute Translations.
* Help us optimize the game's performance.
* Donate to help keep Mesehub running.

Bugs, issues, and requests can be made on the bug tracker of [MineClone2](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/issues) and [MineClone5](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone5/MineClone5/issues)

If you are a programmer:
* Start your workflow:
    * Fork the mineclone repo that you wish to contribute to.
    * Do your changes in a new branch (How-To later in this guide.)
    * Create Pull Requests (PR) to get your changes merged into the main code base.
    * After a PR is merged, you can delete your branch.
* Discuss your changes
* Ask for help if you need it.
* Maintain your code.
* Always test, test, test your changes.
* Follow the guidlines (see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more details).
